## How to load Google Analytics script

**By default nothing is needed: the plugin does everything for you!**

However, in some cases, you might want to avoid auto-loading the analytics.js script because:
- maybe the framework you're using already does it for you
- you really can't remove it from your project
- other issue that I can't come up with

So for all those cases it is possible to let the plugin detect if an analytics script has been added already in your html

```js
import Kdu from 'kdu'
import KduAnalytics from 'kdu-analytics'

Kdu.use(KduAnalytics, {
  id: 'UA-XXX-X',
  checkDuplicatedScript: true
})
```

or just disable the script loader

```js
import Kdu from 'kdu'
import KduAnalytics from 'kdu-analytics'

Kdu.use(KduAnalytics, {
  id: 'UA-XXX-X',
  disableScriptLoader: true
})
```

### Important
It is not possible for the plugin to remove the initial trackers, because it needs them to create all methods for the multi-tracking feature.
**If you can't remove initial trackers, don't use this plugin: the outcome could be unpredictable.**
