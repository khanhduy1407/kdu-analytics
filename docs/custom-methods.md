## Custom methods

Google Analytics has a very big api and sometimes the wrapper might limit you on what you need, so it's still possible to access the plain Analytics api

```js
this.$ga.query(...)
```

if you need more interaction or you want to add specific features, please add an issue on the repo or make a pull request
